# Case

As a senior software engineer, you are tasked with refactoring the filtering feature of an e-commerce website. The current implementation of the filtering feature is based on a custom React hook called useProductFilter and a functional component called FilterBar.
However, the current implementation of the useProductFilter hook and FilterBar component is not very reusable and does not follow best practices for organizing and structuring React code. Your task is to review the current implementation and propose a plan for refactoring the code to make it more reusable and maintainable.
To successfully complete this task, you will need to have strong knowledge of React, React hooks, and best practices for organizing and structuring React code. You will also need to have strong problem-solving and design skills to identify the issues with the current implementation and propose a plan for refactoring the code.
